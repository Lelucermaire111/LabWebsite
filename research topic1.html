        1.	Channel between transmitter and receiver is the transmission medium for wireless communications. Comprehensive channel knowledge obtained by channel measurements and realistic channel models are the cornerstones for the successful design of any communication system.
        <br>
        2.	Our team focuses on developing realistic and easy-to-use channel models for complex high-mobility communication scenarios, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In the developed channel models, typical channel characteristics, i.e., channel non-stationarity in the space-time-frequency domain, inherent channel physical features, i.e., channel consistency in the time-space domain, vehicular traffic density (VTD), and continuously arbitrary trajectories of vehicles and UAVs are considered and captured adequately. 
        <br>
        3.	Comprehensive channel measurements in complex high-mobility communication scenarios are carried out. Meanwhile, in the commercial platform, i.e., Wireless InSite○R, deterministic channel models based on the ray-tracing technology are constructed. The excellent agreement between simulation results and measurements/ray-tracing-based results is achieved, which confirms the accuracy and utility of the proposed channel model.
        <br>
        4.	Based on the proper channel measurement and modeling, our team further conducts research on channel application in complex high-mobility communication scenarios. Specifically, the impacts on VTD, UAV-related parameters, and channel space-time-frequency non-stationarity on the network-level simulation are investigated. The interesting observation can provide useful guidance for the successful design of communication networks in complex high-mobility scenarios.
